## Tips

### Change signature
You can move method parameters in both declaration and invocation with  
`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`←` and `Ctrl`+`Alt`+`Shift`+`→`  . 
Moreover, you can propagate such move in a method declaration to the method invocation:
press   `Alt`+`Enter` after the move and choose **Update usages to reflect signature change**.
