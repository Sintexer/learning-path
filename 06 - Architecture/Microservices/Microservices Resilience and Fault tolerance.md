Resilience and fault tolerance are critical aspects of microservices architecture, ensuring that the system can handle failures gracefully and continue to operate.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents a service from repeatedly trying to execute an operation that is likely to fail, thus avoiding cascading failures.
- **Retries and Timeouts**: Implementing retries with exponential backoff and setting appropriate timeouts for service calls.
- **Bulkheads**: Isolating different parts of the system to prevent failures from spreading.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Providing alternative responses or degraded functionality when a service fails.

**Tools and Libraries:**

- **Hystrix**: A latency and fault tolerance library from Netflix.
- **Resilience4j**: A lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library inspired by Hystrix but designed for Java 8 and functional programming.
