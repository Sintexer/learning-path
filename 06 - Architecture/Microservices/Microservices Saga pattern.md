**What is the Saga Pattern?** The Saga pattern is a design pattern for managing distributed transactions in a microservices architecture. It ensures data consistency across multiple services by breaking down a transaction into a series of smaller, independent steps (sub-transactions), each with its own compensating action to undo the work if necessary.

**Types of Sagas (see [[Microservices Orchestration and Choreography]]):**

1. **Choreography-Based Saga**: Each service involved in the saga publishes events and listens for events from other services. There is no central coordinator.
2. **Orchestration-Based Saga**: A central orchestrator manages the saga, coordinating the execution of steps and invoking compensating actions if needed.

**Steps in a Saga:**

1. **Initiation**: The saga starts with an initial request.
2. **Execution**: Each service performs its part of the transaction and publishes an event or calls the next service.
3. **Compensation**: If a step fails, compensating actions are invoked to undo the previous steps.

**Example:** Consider an e-commerce order process:

1. **Create Order**: The order service creates an order.
2. **Reserve Inventory**: The inventory service reserves the items.
3. **Process Payment**: The payment service processes the payment.
4. **Ship Order**: The shipping service ships the order.

If the payment processing fails, the compensating actions would be:

1. **Cancel Payment**: Revert any partial payment.
2. **Release Inventory**: Release the reserved items.
3. **Cancel Order**: Mark the order as canceled.

**Benefits:**

- **Data Consistency**: Ensures eventual consistency across services.
- **Resilience**: Each step can be retried independently, and compensating actions can handle failures.

**Challenges:**

- **Complexity**: Implementing and managing sagas can be complex.
- **Latency**: Sagas can introduce latency due to the sequential execution of steps and compensating actions.
- **Error Handling**: Requires robust error handling and monitoring to manage compensations effectively.
