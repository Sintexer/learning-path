Service orchestration and choreography are two approaches to managing interactions between microservices.

## Service Orchestration

- **Centralized Control**: A central service (orchestrator) coordinates the interactions between multiple services.
- **Workflow Management**: The orchestrator defines and manages the workflow, making it easier to handle complex business processes.
- **Examples**: BPMN engines like Camunda, Apache Airflow.

## Service Choreography

- **Decentralized Control**: Each service knows how to react to certain events and communicates with other services as needed.
- **Event-Driven**: Services publish and subscribe to events, leading to a more decentralized and flexible interaction model.
- **Examples**: Event-driven systems using message brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
