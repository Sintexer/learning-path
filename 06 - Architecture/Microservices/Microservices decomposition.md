Service decomposition is the process of breaking down a monolithic application into smaller, manageable microservices. Each microservice should encapsulate a specific business capability or domain.

**Approaches to Decomposition:**

- **By Business Capability**: Align services with business functions (e.g., user management, order processing).
- **By Subdomain**: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to identify bounded contexts and create services around them.
- **By Use Case**: Decompose based on specific use cases or user journeys.

**Challenges:**

- **Defining Boundaries**: Ensuring services are cohesive and loosely coupled.
- **Data Management**: Handling data consistency and transactions across services.
