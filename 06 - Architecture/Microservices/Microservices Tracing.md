Distributed tracing helps in tracking and visualizing the flow of requests across multiple microservices. It is essential for debugging and performance optimization in a distributed system.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Trace**: A trace represents the journey of a request as it travels through various services.
- **Span**: A span represents a single unit of work done in a service, including metadata like start time, end time, and tags.
- **Context Propagation**: Passing trace context (trace ID, span ID) across service boundaries to maintain the trace continuity.
- **Tools**: Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry.
