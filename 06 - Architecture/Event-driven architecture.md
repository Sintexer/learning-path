Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a design paradigm where services communicate by producing and consuming events. This approach decouples services and allows them to react to changes asynchronously. 

An event is a change in state, a user request, or an update, like an item being placed in a shopping cart in an e-commerce website. When an event occurs, the information is published for other services to consume it. 

In event-driven architectures, events are the primary mechanism for sharing information across services. These events are observable, such as a new message in a log file, rather than directed, such as a command to specifically do something.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Events**: Represent significant changes or actions within a system (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "UserRegistered").
- **Event Producers**: Services that generate and publish events.
- **Event Consumers**: Services that listen for and react to events.
- **Event Brokers**: Middleware that routes events from producers to consumers (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ).

**Benefits:**

- **Loose Coupling**: Services are decoupled and communicate asynchronously.
- **Scalability**: Easier to scale individual services independently.
- **Resilience**: Services can continue to operate even if some components are down.
