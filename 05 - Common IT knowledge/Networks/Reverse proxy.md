A reverse proxy is a server that accepts a request from the client, forwards the request to web servers, and returns the results to the client as if the proxy server had processed the request (NGINX).

A reverse proxy is good for:

1. Protecting servers
2. Load balancing
3. Caching static contents
4. Encrypting and decrypting SSL communications
