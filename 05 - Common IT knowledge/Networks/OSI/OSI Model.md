> AKA **Open Systems Interconnection**

The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)** model is a conceptual framework that describes the seven (7) layers of network communication. It was developed by the [[ISO]] in the 1980s to promote interoperability between different computer systems.

The OSI model consists of seven layers, each with its own specific functions:

- [[OSI 1 layer]] - **Physical layer**
- [[OSI 2 layer]] - **Data Link layer**
- [[OSI 3 layer]] - **Network layer**
- [[OSI 4 layer]] - **Transport layer**
- [[OSI 5 layer]] - **Session layer**
- [[OSI 6 layer]] - **Presentation layer**
- [[OSI 7 layer]] - **Application layer**
