Although running one instance is uncomplicated to manage, it lacks high availability and scalability. Most companies and organizations run many containers on many instances.
  
If youâ€™re trying to manage your compute at a large scale, you should consider the following:
- How to place your containers on your instances
- What happens if your container fails
- What happens if your instance fails
- How to monitor deployments of your containers

This coordination is handled by a **container orchestration service**. Most popular choice for today is [[Kubernetes|K8S]]. Cloud platforms also offer their own orchestration services. AWS offers two container orchestration services: [[AWS Elastic Container Service|Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)]] and [[|Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)]].
