> AKA Teletypewriter

Teletypewriters (TTYs) were indeed used as a more automated and efficient form of telegraphy. Instead of sending messages in Morse code and having the receiving party manually transcribe the message, TTYs could send and receive typed text messages automatically. The devices could communicate with each other over telegraph or telephone lines, encoding each character as a specific series of electrical signals.

When computers came into widespread use, TTYs were repurposed as a way for operators to input commands and receive output from computers. Input would be typed in on the keyboard, and the output would be printed on paper.

Then, as technology advanced, TTYs were paired with screens to create what we refer to as computer terminals. These terminals still took input from keyboards but were able to display output on a screen, which was more efficient and flexible than printing on paper via a TTY. Terminals were not independent computers, but rather input/output devices connected to a mainframe computer.

As standalone personal computers became more powerful and widespread, they started to replace mainframe-and-terminal setups. Today, while physical TTYs and terminals are somewhat rare, terminal emulators, which mimic the behavior of a TTY or a terminal within a graphical interface, are widely used in almost all modern operating systems.
