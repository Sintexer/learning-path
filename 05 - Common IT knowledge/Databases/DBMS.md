- **Data Manipulation:** Inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data within the database.
- **Data Security:** Ensuring data integrity, consistency, and access control through user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Concurrency:** Managing concurrent access to the database by multiple users, preventing data corruption.
- **Data Recovery:** Providing mechanisms to recover data in case of system failures or accidental deletion.
- **Performance Optimization:** Tuning and optimizing database queries for faster data retrieval and processing.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Backing up the database regularly and restoring it in case of failures.
- **User Management:** Creating and managing user accounts with different access levels and permissions.
