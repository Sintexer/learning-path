The availability of a system is typically expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year or as a number of nines. In the following table is a list of availability percentages based on the downtime per year and its notation in nines. 

| **Availability (%)**                            | **Downtime (per year)** |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 90% (one nine of availability)                  | 36.53 days              |
| 99% (two nines of availability)                 | 3.65 days               |
| 99.9% (three nines of availability)             | 8.77 hours              |
| 99.95% (three and a half nines of availability) | 4.38 hours              |
| 99.99% (four nines of availability)             | 52.60 minutes           |
| 99.995% (four and a half nines of availability) | 26.30 minutes           |
| 99.999% (five nines of availability)            | 5.26 minutes            |

To increase availability, you need redundancy. This typically means more infrastructure—more data centers, more servers, more databases, and more replication of data. You can imagine that adding more of this infrastructure means a higher cost. Customers want the application to always be available, but you need to draw a line where adding redundancy is no longer viable in terms of revenue.

Two ways to increase availability are [[Active-active systems]] and [[Active-passive systems]].
