> AKA **Uniform Resource Locator**

A URL is a subset of [[URI]] that specifies **where a recognized resource is available** and **how it can be retrieved**. It's essentially a web address and comprises:

- Scheme (Protocol)
- Address (Domain Name and Path)

## Difference between URI and URL

All *URLs are URIs,* but *not all URIs are URLs*. A URI identifies a resource by location, name, or both. If it identifies a resource by location, it's a URL. **Some URIs are not URLs as they might identify a resource by name rather than by location.**

> In typical web-discussion context, most people use the term URL even when they technically mean URI.
