With **serverless compute**, you can spend time on the things that differentiate your application, rather than spending time on ensuring *availability*, *scaling*, and *managing servers*. **Serverless** is a *cloud computing model* where you don't have to manage *servers* or *infrastructure*. Instead, you simply write and deploy your code, and the cloud **provider takes care** of everything else. Every definition of serverless mentions the following four aspects:

- There are **no servers** to provision or manage.
- It **scales** with usage.
- You **never pay for idle** resources.
- **Availability** and **fault tolerance** are built in.

> Imagine a restaurant where you only pay for the food you eat, not the kitchen staff, equipment, or utilities. That's essentially the concept of serverless computing.

* **You write your code:** Focus on your application logic without worrying about server setup or maintenance.
* **Cloud provider manages servers:** The cloud provider dynamically allocates and scales servers based on your code's needs.
* **You pay per execution:** You only pay for the time your code is actually running, not for idle servers.

## Benefits of serverless

* **Cost-effective:** You only pay for what you use, reducing infrastructure costs.
* **Scalable:** The cloud provider automatically scales your application based on demand.
* **Faster development:** You can focus on coding without server management distractions.
* **Increased reliability:** The cloud provider handles server maintenance and updates.

## When to use serverless?

Serverless is ideal for applications that:

* **Are event-driven:** Respond to events like user actions or data changes.
* **Have unpredictable traffic:** Scale up and down automatically based on demand.
* **Need fast development cycles:** Focus on coding without server management overhead.

## Examples of serverless services

* [[AWS Lambda|AWS Lambda:]] Run code (functions) without provisioning or managing servers.
- [[AWS Fargate]]: Run containers without managing servers.
* **Google Cloud Functions:** Deploy code that automatically scales based on events.
* **Azure Functions:** Build and run event-driven applications without managing infrastructure.

**Remember:**

* Serverless doesn't mean "no servers." The cloud provider still manages them, but you don't have to.
* It's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Consider your application's needs before choosing serverless.
