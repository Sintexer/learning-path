**CloudWatch Logs** is centralized place for logs to be stored and analyzed. With this service, you can monitor, store, and access your log files from applications running on instances and other sources.

With CloudWatch Logs, you can query and filter your log data, or set up metric filters on logs, which turn log data into numerical [[AWS CloudWatch]] metrics that you can graph and use on your dashboards.  
  
Some services, like [[AWS Lambda]], are set up to send log data to **CloudWatch Logs** with minimal effort. With Lambda, all you need to do is give the Lambda function the correct [[IAM policies|IAM permissions]] to post logs to CloudWatch Logs. Other services require more configuration. For example, to send your application logs from an [[EC2]] instance into CloudWatch Logs, you need to install and configure the **CloudWatch Logs agent** on the EC2 instance. With the CloudWatch Logs agent, EC2 instances can automatically send log data to CloudWatch Logs.

Log data sent to CloudWatch Logs can come from different sources, so it’s important you understand how they’re organized. **Event** is a single log message, identified by a timestamp. **Log stream** is a group of events related to the same resource. **Log Group** is composed of log streams that all share same retention and permission settings (e.g., group multiple EC2 instance logs together).
