AWS X-Ray provides developers with insights into the **behavior of their applications**, enabling them to understand how they are performing and where *bottlenecks* are occurring. This application **tracing** service helps identify and debug performance bottlenecks in applications. X-Ray offers powerful filtering, visualization capabilities, request tracing and seamless integration with other AWS services.

## Key Features

##### Request tracing

One of the key features of AWS X-Ray is that it allows you to trace requests from start to end across all touchpoints, enabling you to map out and understand the path of an API call or user transaction, even when such routes pass through different service boundaries.

##### Service Map

AWS X-Ray provides a visual console, known as **Service Map**, which allows developers to visually identify trouble spots within an application. The Service Map view shows response times, latency, and other useful statistics, enabling you to see a holistic view of your application and quickly identify areas where issues are occurring.

##### Filter Expressions

X-Ray also provides **Filter Expressions** which help you to focus on the requests that you care about such as focusing on calls that were slow or resulted in an error. This provides users with a powerful tool for quickly isolating problems and identifying their root cause.

##### AWS services integration

Another major advantage is its deep integration with other AWS Services. AWS X-Ray works seamlessly with [[EC2]], [[AWS Elastic Container Service]], [[AWS Lambda]], and [[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]], allowing developers to trace requests made to applications hosted on these services.

## Pricing

You pay only for the traces you record and retrieve, and there are no upfront commitments required. This flexible pricing means that you can adapt your usage based on your needs, saving costs during lower usage periods.
