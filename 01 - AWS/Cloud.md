There are different types of hosts: **on-premises, cloud, and hybrid solutions**. 

# Different types of deployments
## On-premises 

Before the cloud companies and organizations hosted hardware, including computing, storage and network equipment. It often required to be handled by a special infrastructure department, which resulted in costly operations that made some workloads and experimentation impossible. With the growth of the internet, demand for compute, storage and networking equipment increased. The cost of infrastructure became unbearable for many companies, but cloud solutions helped in solving this problem. Company might even have bigger data center and some of computation power will be left unused, but will provide costs anyway.

> Scenario: developers must deploy a new application feature. Before they deploy, the team wants to test the feature in a separate quality assurance (QA) environment that has the same configurations as production. In an on-premises solution, an additional environment requires you to buy and install hardware, connect the necessary cabling, provision power, install operating systems, and more. These tasks can be time consuming and expensive. Meanwhile, the new featureâ€™s time-to-market increases while the developers wait for the QA environment.
## Cloud

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with primarily **pay-as-you-go** pricing. With cloud computing, companies do not have to manage and maintain their hardware and data centers. Cloud providers offer virtual data center technologies.

> Scenario: same as in on-premises - team needs to deploy a replica of an existing app to test new feature in QA. By running your application in the cloud, you can replicate an entire production environment in a matter of minutes or even seconds. Instead of physically installing hardware and connecting cabling, the solution is managed over the internet.
## Hybrid

This type of deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure connects cloud resources to internal systems to extend and grow an organization's infrastructure into the cloud.

# Cloud pros

**Six advantages of cloud computing:**
1. **Pay-as-you-go** - paying only for the resources that you use.
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**: in cloud you can achieve lower cost than you can get on your own. Because from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go.
3. **Stop guessing capacity**: scale up and down dynamically based o current demand.
4. **Increase speed and agility**: it is much faster to deploy app in cloud rather than on on-premises equipment.
5. **Realize cost savings**: you can deploy separate resources for each client rather than stacking up on-premises servers.
6. **Go global in minutes**: Applications can be deployed in multiple Regions around the world with a few clicks.
