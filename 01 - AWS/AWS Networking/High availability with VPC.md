When you create your subnets, keep high availability in mind. To maintain redundancy and fault tolerance, create **at least two subnets** configured in **two [[Availability Zone|Availability Zones]]**.  
  
As you learned earlier, remember that “everything fails all of the time.” With the example network, if one of the [[Availability Zone|Availability Zones]] fails, you will still have your resources available in another **Availability Zone** as backup.
