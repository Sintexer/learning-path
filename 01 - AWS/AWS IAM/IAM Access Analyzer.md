You can use IAM Access Analyzer to help identify the required permissions for the [[IAM role]]. **IAM Access Analyzer** reviews your [[AWS CloudTrail]] logs over the date range that you specify and generates a policy template with only the permissions that the function used during that time. For more information on IAM Access Analyzer, see [Using IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html) in the _AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide_.
