Restricts permissions for entities in an AWS account, including AWS account root users

[[AWS Organizations]] is a service for grouping and centrally managing AWS accounts. If you enable all features in an organization, then you can apply SCPs to any or all of your accounts. SCPs specify the maximum permissions for an account, or a group of accounts, called an organizational unit (OU).Â
