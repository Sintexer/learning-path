With AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, you don't need to write consumer applications or manage shards like you do for [[AWS Kinesis]]. You configure your data producers to send data to Kinesis Data Firehose, and it automatically delivers the data to a destination that you specify.

AWS Kinesis Data Firehose is a [[AWS Managed Service|fully managed service]] for delivering real-time streaming data to destinations such as [[AWS S3]], [[AWS Redshift]], [[AWS Elasticsearch Service]].

Key Features of Kinesis Data Firehose:

- **Scalability** is a key feature of Kinesis Data Firehose. It can handle streaming data at a massive scale, from a few kilobytes to terabytes per hour.
- **Real-Time Data Delivery** is another significant feature. Kinesis Data Firehose captures, transforms, and loads data into AWS data stores in near real-time.
- **Data Transformation** is a built-in feature of Kinesis Data Firehose. It can convert the format of input data, like converting Apache logs into JSON, before delivering it to the destination.
- **Integration with AWS Services** is seamless with Kinesis Data Firehose. It can directly ingest data into data lakes and data stores on AWS.

The main alternative of AWS Kinesis Data Firehose is [[AWS Kinesis Data Streams]]. Firehouse offers a simpler management experience and autoscaling, but lacks flexibility in terms of configuration. See [[AWS Kinesis Data Streams vs Firehose]] comparison for a deeper comparison of two services.
