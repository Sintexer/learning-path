# Shared responsibility

==AWS manages security **OF** the cloud==, while ==users must manage security **IN** the cloud==. This is called **shared responsibility** between AWS and you. 

### AWS responsibilities 

AWS is responsible for security of the cloud. This means that AWS protects and secures the infrastructure that runs the services offered in the AWS Cloud. It includes protecting and securing AWS [[Region]], [[Availability Zone]]s, and [[Data Center]]s, down to the physical security of the buildings for low-level services ([[EC2]]), and managing hardware and software and encryption for services with higher levels of abstraction ([[Storage and S3#Simple Storage Service (S3)|S3]]).

### User responsibilities

The customers' level of responsibility depends on the AWS service. Some services require the customer to perform all the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Other more abstracted services require customers to only manage the data and control access to their resources.
