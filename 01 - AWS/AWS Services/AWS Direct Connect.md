To establish a *secure* **physical connection** between your *on-premises* data center and your [[AWS VPC]], you can use **AWS Direct Connect**. With AWS Direct Connect, your internal network is linked to an AWS Direct Connect location over a *standard Ethernet fiber-optic cable*. This connection allows you to create virtual interfaces directly to public AWS services or to your VPC.
