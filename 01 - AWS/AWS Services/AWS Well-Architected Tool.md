The AWS Well-Architected Tool is a self-service tool that is designed to help customers review AWS workloads at any time without the need for an AWS solutions architect. By using this tool, you can review your workloads using a consistent process, understand potential risks in your workload architectures, and identify next steps for improvement. 

First, define your workload, and then answer a set of questions across the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. The AWS Well-Architected Tool then provides a plan describing the improvements that can be applied to the workload. Thereâ€™s no charge for the AWS Well-Architected Tool; you pay for only any AWS resources that you consume. However, the tool is available only in select Regions.
