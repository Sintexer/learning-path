API Gateway is a service that facilitates the creation, publishing, maintenance, monitoring, and security of your [[API|APIs]] at any scale. API Gateway handles all your tasks around accepting and processing hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls. This includes handling traffic management, [[CORS]] support, [[Authorization|authorization]] and access control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management.

> [!example] **Example: Social identity provider API**
> Authenticating into an application using social identity providers such as Amazon, Facebook, or Google. When you select this option while logging in, the application will communicate with the social media provider's API to authenticate you using your identity provider account.

## Architecture

Usually a request to API Gateway starts from a mobile, web app or some API service. They access though HTTPS and can reach [[AWS CloudFront]] thank to how API Gateway is designed. Gateway first tries to fulfill the request using the response cache, otherwise it pass request to the [[üóÇÔ∏è AWS Compute]], any publicly accessible endpoint, or some [[AWS VPC]].

API Gateway comes in three forms:

- [[AWS REST API Gateway]] - are intended for APIs that require API proxy functionality and API management features in a single solution.
- [[AWS HTTP API Gateway]] - are optimized for building APIs that proxy to Lambda functions or HTTP backends, making them ideal for serverless workloads. Cheaper and faster compared to REST APIs.
- [[AWS WebSocket API Gateway]]

## Features

**Reduce latency and throttle traffic**: API Gateway provides end users with the lowest possible latency for API requests and responses by taking advantage of the [[AWS CloudFront]] global network of [[Edge locations|edge locations]]. With this service, you also can **throttle** traffic and authorize API calls to ensure that backend operations withstand traffic spikes and backend systems are not unnecessarily called.

**Build-in, flexible authorization options**: API Gateway gives you several options for authorization. You can authorize access to your APIs with [[IAM]] and [[AWS Cognito]]. If you use [[OAuth token|OAuth tokens]], API Gateway also offers native [[OIDC]] and [[OAuth 2]] support.¬†To support custom authorization requirements, you can invoke a [[AWS Lambda]] authorizer from Lambda. With a **Lambda authorizer**, you can develop your own authorization code using a custom Lambda function.

**API keys for third-party developers**: If you‚Äôre using REST APIs, API Gateway helps you manage the ecosystem of third-party developers accessing your APIs. You can create API keys on API Gateway, set fine-grained access permissions on each API key, and distribute them to third-party developers to access your APIs. API keys are not a primary authorization mechanism for your APIs, but provide you the ability to track usage for specific users or services. You can also define usage plans that set throttling and request quota limits for each API key. The use of API keys is optional.
