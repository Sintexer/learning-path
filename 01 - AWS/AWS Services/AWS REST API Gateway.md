> One implementation of [[AWS API Gateway]]

[[REST]] defines a set of functions such as GET, PUT, and DELETE that clients can use to access server data. Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.

The main feature of a REST API is **statelessness**. Statelessness means that servers do not save client data between requests. Client requests to the server are similar to URLs you type in your browser to visit a website. The response from the server is plain data, without the typical graphical rendering of a web page.

REST APIs offer API proxy functionality and API management features in a single solution. REST APIs also offer API management features such as usage plans, API keys, publishing, and monetizing APIs.

REST API Gateway could be used for existing apps, while [[AWS HTTP API Gateway]] is designed and optimized for a usage with private subnets of Lambda functions.
