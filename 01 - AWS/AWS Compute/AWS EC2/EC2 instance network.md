> Network (instance location)

Unless otherwise specified, when you launch EC2 instances, they are placed in a default [[Virtual Private Cloud|virtual private cloud (VPC)]]. The **default VPC** is suitable for getting started quickly and launching public EC2 instances without having to create and configure your own VPC.

Any resource that you put inside the **default VPC** will be public and accessible by the internet, so **you shouldnâ€™t place** any customer data or private information in it.
