### Instance family

Each instance family is optimized to fit different use cases. AWS has:

- **General purpose** - for apps that use resources in equal proportions.
- **Compute optimized** - high-performance processors.
- **Memory optimized** - for apps with demand to top RAM speed, like caches, high-performance DBs, etc.
- **Accelerated computing** - Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators or co-processors to perform functions such as floating-point number calculations, graphics processing, or data pattern matching more efficiently, used for Machine learning, etc.
- **Storage optimized** - high sequential read and write access to large datasets on local storage, for NoSQL DBs, in-memory DBs, Elasticsearch, etc.
- **HPC Optimized** - High performance computing (HPC) instances are purpose built to offer the best price performance for running HPC workloads at scale on AWS. For complex simulations and deep learning workloads.
