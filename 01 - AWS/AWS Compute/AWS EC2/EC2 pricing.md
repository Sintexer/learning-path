One of the ways to reduce costs with [[EC2|Amazon EC2]] is to choose the right **pricing** option for the way that your applications run. AWS offers a variety of pricing options to address different workload scenarios.

## Pricing options

### 1 On-Demand instances

With **On-Demand Instances**, you pay for compute capacity *per hour* or *per second*, depending on which instances that you run. There are no long-term commitments or upfront payments required. Billing begins whenever the instance is running, and billing stops when the instance is in a stopped or terminated state (See [[EC2 lifecycle]]). You can increase or decrease your compute capacity to meet the demands of your application and only pay the specified hourly rates for the instance that you use.  

On-Demand Instances are recommended for the following use cases:

- Users who prefer the **low cost and flexibility** of Amazon EC2 without upfront payment or long-term commitments            
- Applications with **short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads** that cannot be interrupted
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time

### 2 Spot instances

For applications that have flexible start and end times, Amazon EC2 offers the **Spot Instances** option. With Amazon EC2 Spot Instances, you can request *spare Amazon EC2* computing capacity for *up to 90 percent* off the **On-Demand** price. Spot Instances are recommended for the following use cases:

- Applications that have **flexible start and end times**            
- Applications that are only feasible at very **low compute prices**            
- Users with **fault-tolerant** or **stateless** workloads            

With Spot Instances, you **set a limit** on how much you want to pay for the instance hour. This is compared against the current Spot price that AWS determines. Spot Instance prices adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and demand for Spot Instance capacity. If the amount that you pay is more than the current Spot price and there is capacity, you will receive an instance.

> Imagine requesting an instance at a specific price. If your price **matches the current AWS price**, the instance will boot up. This approach is suitable for applications that **don't require 24/7** availability.
> For example, consider a microservice that **doesn't generate significant profit**. It could be configured to turn on only when its price is low according to the **current AWS workload**. In such scenarios, clients should expect the microservice to **be unavailable occasionally**.

### 3 Saving plans

**Savings Plans** are a flexible pricing model that offers **low usage prices** for a **1-year** or **3-year** term commitment to a *consistent amount of usage*. Savings Plans apply to [[EC2|Amazon EC2]], [[AWS Lambda]], and [[AWS Fargate]] usage and provide up to **72 percent savings** on AWS compute usage.  

For workloads that have predictable and consistent usage, Savings Plans can provide significant savings compared to **On-Demand** Instances. Savings Plans are recommended for the following use cases:

- Workloads with a **consistent** and steady-state **usage**            
- Customers who want to use **different instance types** and compute solutions across different locations        
- Customers who can make monetary commitment to use Amazon EC2 over a **1-year** or **3-year term**

### 4 Reserved instances

For applications with **steady state usage** that might require reserved capacity, [[EC2|Amazon EC2]] offers the **Reserved Instances** option. With this option, you save up to **75 percent** compared to **On-Demand Instance** pricing. You can choose between three payment options: **All Upfront**, **Partial Upfront**, or **No Upfront**. You can select either a **1-year** or **3-year** term for each of these options. 

With Reserved Instances, you can choose the type that best fits your applications needs.     

- **Standard Reserved Instances**: These provide the most significant discount (up to 72 percent off On-Demand pricing) and are best suited for steady-state usage.     
- **Convertible Reserved Instances**: These provide a discount (up to 54 percent off On-Demand pricing) and the capability to change the attributes of the Reserved Instance if the exchange results in the creation of Reserved Instances of equal or greater value. Like Standard Reserved Instances, Convertible Reserved Instances are best suited for steady-state usage.        
- **Scheduled Reserved Instances**: These are available to launch within the time windows that you reserve. With this option, you can match your capacity reservation to a predictable recurring schedule that only requires a fraction of a day, a week, or a month.

### 5 Dedicated hosts

A Dedicated Host is a physical **Amazon EC2 server** that is dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs because you can use your existing server-bound software licenses, such as Windows Server, SQL Server, and Oracle licenses. And they can also help you meet compliance requirements. Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is also integrated with [[AWS License Manager]].

- Dedicated Hosts can be purchased on demand (hourly).
- Dedicated Hosts can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70 percent off the On-Demand price.
