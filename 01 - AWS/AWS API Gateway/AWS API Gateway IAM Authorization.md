If you have an internal service or a restricted number of customers, [[IAM]] is a great choice for authorization, especially for applications that use IAM to interact with other AWS services using [[IAM role|IAM roles]]. When you turn on IAM Authorization, all request are required to be signed using AWS Version 4 signing process (also known as [[AWS Sig v4]]). During authorization, user exchanges access key and secret key to compute an [[HMAC]] signature using [[SHA 256]]. The key information is then added to the Authorization header and API Gateway then parses it to decide whether client is authorized to perform an action or not.
