As an alternative to using IAM or Lambda authorizers, you can use Amazon Cognito and a Cognito User Pool to control access to your APIs. To use Cognito authorizer, you must first create an authorizer of the `COGNITO_USER_POOLS` authorizer type, and then configure an API method to use the authorizer. After a user is authenticated against the user pool, they obtain an [[OIDC]] token formatted in JSON web token. Then this toke can be used by your application to inject information into a header in subsequent API calls that you make against you API Gateway endpoint.
