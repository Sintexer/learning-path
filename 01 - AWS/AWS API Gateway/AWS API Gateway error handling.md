For invalid requests, API Gateway bypasses the integration altogether and returns an error response. By default, the error response contains a short descriptive error message.Â 

For some of the error responses, API Gateway allows customization by API developers to return the responses in different formats. You can access the Gateway Responses option on the API Gateway console. Some of the customization of various error responses you can use are:

- Change HTTP status code.
- Modify body content.
- Add headers.

In addition to these, you can also customize specific responses or modify the default 4xx or 5xx error response.
