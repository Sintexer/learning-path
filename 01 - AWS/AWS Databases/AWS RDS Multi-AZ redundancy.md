## Redundancy with Amazon RDS Multi-AZ

In an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS creates a redundant copy of your database in another [[Availability Zone]]. You end up with two copies of your databaseâ€”a **primary copy** in a subnet in one Availability Zone and a **standby copy** in a subnet in a second Availability Zone.  
  
The primary copy of your database provides access to your data so that applications can query and display the information. The data in the primary copy is synchronously replicated to the standby copy. The standby copy is not considered an active database, and it does not get queried by applications.

When you create a DB instance, a [[DNS]] name is provided. AWS uses that DNS name to fail over to the standby database. In an automatic failover, the standby database is promoted to the primary role, and queries are redirected to the new primary database.  
  
To help ensure that you don't lose Multi-AZ configuration, there are two ways you can create a new standby database. They are as follows:

- Demote the previous primary to standby if it's still up and running.
- Stand up a new standby DB instance.

The reason you can select multiple subnets for an Amazon RDS database is because of the Multi-AZ configuration. **You will want to ensure that you have subnets in different Availability Zones for your primary and standby copies.**
