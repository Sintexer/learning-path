Suppose you are running your [[Relational Database|relational database]] on [[EC2]]. If you host a database on EC2, AWS implements and maintains the physical infrastructure and hardware and installs the EC2 instance operating system (OS). However, you are still responsible for managing the EC2 instance, managing the database on that host, optimizing queries, and managing customer data.  
  
This is called an **unmanaged** database option. In this option, AWS is responsible for and has control over the hardware and underlying infrastructure. You are responsible for and have control over management of the host and database.
