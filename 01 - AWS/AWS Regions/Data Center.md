Data is stored in a **Data Center**. Data center is an isolated unit with redundant power system and data storage and computing cluster. But what if natural disaster destroys whole Data Center? AWS clusters several Data Centers into an [[Availability Zone]]. So if one DC has collapsed, another DC inside AZ will stand instead of it and users might not even see the difference - all the data is redundantly stores across several Data Centers.
