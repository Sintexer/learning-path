> **Authentication answers the question, "Are you who you say you are?" Authorization answers the question, "What actions can you perform?"**

## Authentication

Usually users uses the combination of an email address and a password to verify your identity. If a user types in the correct email address and password, the system assumes the user is allowed to enter and grants them access. This is the process of **authentication**.  
  
==**Authentication** ensures that the user is who they say they are.== User names and passwords are the most common types of authentication. But you might also work with other forms, such as token-based authentication or biometric data, like a fingerprint. Authentication simply answers the question, “Are you who you say you are?”

## Authorization

After you’re authenticated and in your account, you might be curious about *what actions you can take*. This is where authorization comes in. **Authorization** is the process of giving users permission to access AWS resources and services. **Authorization** determines whether a user can perform certain actions, such as read, edit, delete, or create resources. ==**Authorization** answers the question, “What actions can you perform?”==
