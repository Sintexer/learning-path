The security principle of least privilege means giving a user or system only those privileges that are essential to perform its intended function. For example, a user who works in supporting databases does not need to manage the network. By applying this principle you can protect your application from worst case scenarios when credentials are lost or compromised. Even with the credentials intruder will fail to steal bank information if the only thing he has is weather service permissions.

1. **Grant access as needed** - Grant access to data and other resources to only the people who really need that access. You can start with denying access to everything and grant access as needed based on job role.
2. **Enforce separation of duties** - Enforcing separation of duties with appropriate authorization for each interaction with your resources is a security best practice. Set expectations on how authority will be delegated down through software engineers, operations staff, and other job functions involved in cloud adoption.
3. **Avoid long-term credentials** - By centralizing privilege management and reducing or even eliminating reliance on long-term credentials, you can reduce your potential risk. Making use of temporary security credentials that eventually expire is a great way to limit exposure to your resources.
