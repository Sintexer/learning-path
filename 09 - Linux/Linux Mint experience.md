After trying the [[Ubuntu experience|Ubuntu]] I switched to the linux Mint. I heard of it as a stable, convinient linux system, which is ubuntu like, but has another desktop environment. Installation process was like a breeze, everything went cool. I've installed the system and was pretty happy with it. After ubuntu, I didn't quite enjoyed cinnamon, but I respected the long list of pre-installed apps on mint. I hate it now, though. After couple of hours, system began to lag enourmously. It just lagged for several seconds straight occasionally. Like I am scrolling the forum - bam- lag for 6 seconds. I am trying to open task manager - bam - another lag. I tried to google the problem, but I just haven't had power to deal with this problem. One can say I just gave up - after three days of f with linux I just wanted a working system back, despite of the distribution. So I looked to [[Fedora experience|Fedora]] - the only Linux I was happy about before.
