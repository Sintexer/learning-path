## Best practices

1. **Establish Clear Guidelines** - form a project wide code style rules. Form a review checklist for common issues to look for.
2. **Automate Where Possible** - use static analysis tools and CI/CD integrations.
3. **Focus on the Code, Not the Author** - provide a constructive feedback, avoid personal criticism.
4. **Review Small, Incremental Changes** - encourage small pull requests, perform frequent reviews - do not leave pull requests ignored for a long time.
5. **Prioritize Important Issues** - critical issues first. For minor issues - remember them but don't let them block the approval process.
6. **Document and Share Knowledge** - encourage code comments and documentation.
7. **Use a Standard Review Process** - establish a consistent workflow for submitting, reviewing, and merging code changes.
8. **Follow Up on Feedback** - ensure all pull request comments were acknowledged by changes author before the merge.
