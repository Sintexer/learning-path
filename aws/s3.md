# S3

1. Block stores:
	1. EBS.
	2. EC2 instance store.
2. File store (EFS - Elastic file system).
3. Object stores:
	1. S3.
	2. Glacier.

## EBS

Could be **SSD** or **HDD** backed. SSD: gp3, gp2, io1, io2. HDD: st1, sc1.

**EBS snapshots best practices:**

1. Incremental (only changed should be snapped).
2. Could be done during instance running, but better not to do it during high load.
3. Max 100\_000 snapshots.
4. Can be duplicated acros AZ.
5. Should be warmed up after unsealing.
6. Could be automated using AWS Lifecycle management.
7. You can make AMI from snapshot.
8. Snapshots are stored in S3.

**EBS Ecnryption:**

1. Everything is encrypted (volume, data transfered between volume and instance, snapshots, volumes from snapshots).
2. Encryption is transparent, without your efforts.
3. Low impact on latency.
4. KMS keys could be used.
5. Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted.

**EBS Migration:**

1. EBS volumes are locked to specific AZ.
2. To migrate you need to make snapshot, copy snapshot to different AZ, unseal snapshot.

**EBS vs Instance store:**

Instance store is physically attached to the machine, while EBS volume is a network drive.

`+` Instance store has better perfomance.
`+` Good for buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content.
`+` Data survives reboot.

`-` On *stop* or *termination* instance store is lost.
`-` You can't resize the instance store.
`-` backups *must* be operated by user.

**Use cases:**

- `gp2` and `gp3` (General Purpose `SSD`) balance price and performance. Are ideal for use cases such as
boot volumes, medium-size single instance databases, and development and test environments.
- `io1` and `io2` (Provisioned IOPS `SSD`) support up to 64,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s of throughput. This
enables you to predictably scale to tens of thousands of IOPS per EC2 instance.
- `st1` (Throughput Optimized `HDD`) low-cost storage that defines performance in terms of throughput
rather than IOPS. These volumes are ideal for large, sequential workloads such as Amazon EMR, ETL, data
warehouses, and log processing.
- `sc1` (Cold HDD) provide low-cost magnetic storage that defines performance in terms of throughput rather
than IOPS. These volumes are ideal for large, sequential, cold-data workloads. If you require **infrequent
access** to your data and are looking to save costs, these volumes provide inexpensive block storage.
